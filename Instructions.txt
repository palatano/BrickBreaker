Welcome to BrickBreaker,

The goal of the game is to control the two paddles to bounce
the ball and hit all of the bricks. In order to advance to the next
level, all of the bricks must be cleared. The game can either be
played with one player or two players; however, the scores
and the lives are pooled together. If the ball hits either the
left or the bottom wall, you lose a life. If you lose all three lives,
it's game over, man. There are a total of three levels to complete.
The controls for the game are shown below:

W - Move orange paddle right. 
S - Move orange paddle down.
UP - Move cyan paddle up.
DOWN - Move cyan paddle down.
Reset - Reset the score, level, and lives.

Hitting each brick adds 100 points to the total score. There are three
power-ups in the game:

Red Block - Longer paddles
Blue Block - Paddles move in opposite direction when key is pressed.
Green Block - 500 points.

Just hit OK.
